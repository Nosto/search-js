# Typescript code style guide

* Use closures over classes
* Utilize type inference in return types, except for functions with multiple return statements
* Use utility types to derive types from constants
* Use const (and let) over var
* Use async/await instead of Promise chaining 
* Use individual named exports over bulk exports
* Favor named exports over default exports
