# Coding standards

* Use closures over classes
* Utilize type inference in return types, except for functions with multiple return statements
* Use utility types to derive types from constants
* Avoid 'any' type usage
* Use const (and let) over var
* Use async/await instead of Promise chaining 
* Use individual named exports over bulk exports
* Favor named exports over default exports
* Use function declarations for top-level functions instead of arrow function expressions
